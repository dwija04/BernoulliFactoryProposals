# BernoulliFactoryProposals
This repository contains the code for all the examples give in the paper titled "Exact MCMC Sampling for Intractable Proposals" by Dwija Kakkad and Dootika Vats. Each folder contains .RData files, .R files and the corresponding output files. The plots generated are given in a 'plots' folder. The .RData file for a single chain in the Cox modulated GP example is not given due to its large size and can be obtained by running the 'cox_single_run' file.
